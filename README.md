# RSRHH: Resonant spiking dynamics in a reduced Hodgkin-Huxley model

This model simulates integrator versus resonant spiking behavior in a persistent sodium + potassium model and implements some of the parameters given in Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitibility and Bursting by Izhikevich (2007).
